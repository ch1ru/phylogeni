  If you would like more information about the Phylogeny Explorer Project, please contact one of our admins, or apply to become a member in our Facebook group, [Phylogeny Explorer Development](https://www.facebook.com/groups/phylogenyexplorerdevelopment/).

  At the moment we grant only access to the Explorer if you meet one of multiple conditions:

  You are volunteering with us.
  1. Have made a donation present or in the past.
  2. Granting access at this point in time costs the Phylogeny Explorer Project lots of money and infrastructure. Once we are fully running we will give limited access to all people.

  Please note we're in Alpha stage meaning we do not yet have the ability to edit the tree. Meaning not everything is in the correct order.
